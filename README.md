# EdgeAutomation
Microsoft Edge Automation project

All about the project:
  In our clg, everyone of us do 33 searches on Microsfot Edge browsser beacuse it gives you reward of $500 if you do so till 1 &   half month. but i was so lazy but don't even wanted to miss my pocket money, so what i did was, i searched on internet that       can we able to do searches from the system itlsef by programming or writing a code for it.

  Then I found one of the results which was about the Selenium web driver and then I began to do this project for myself first     then it was fabulously working : with just a click we'll get 90 searches in around 3 mins...
    In that two mins, I can go for washroom and till i come back, the searches will be done and my points  will be credited!

    but the thing is if, Edge Browser caught you doing the web automation it can block your acc, So I have implemented Thread.sleep() methods to give some intermediate time between the searches and the search inputs were modified to two words totally 15 letters randomly on each search!

    And now I'm planning it to create desktop app of it so that my friends can also use it but with some twists...ðŸ¤«
